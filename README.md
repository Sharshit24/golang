## üìÅ Structure

Each folder contains a focused example:

- **[1_hello_world](1_hello_world/main.go)**: Your first Go program‚Äîprints "Hello, World!"
- **[2_simple](2_simple/main.go)**: Basic data types, printing, and expressions.
- **[3_variables](3_variables/main.go)**: Introduction to variables and strings.
- **[4_constants](4_constants/main.go)**: Using constants in Go.
- **[5_for](5_for/main.go)**: Loops, conditionals, and logical operators.
- **[6_switch](6_switch/main.go)**: Switch statements and type switches.
- **[7_functions](7_functions/main.go)**: Defining and using functions.
- **[8_arrays_slices](8_arrays_slices/main.go)**: Working with arrays and slices.
- **[9_maps](9_maps/main.go)**: Using maps (dictionaries) in Go.
- **[10_structs](10_structs/main.go)**: Structs and basic object-oriented concepts.
- **[11_interfaces](11_interfaces/main.go)**: Interfaces and polymorphism.
- **[12_concurrency](12_concurrency/main.go)**: Goroutines and channels for concurrency.
